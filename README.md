# Why?
Working as an actual Software Engineer showed us how different the interview process is from the actual job. Having spent countless hours studying and preparing for interviews taught us how broken the interview process is. Thus, we present Developers Path. A better way for Software Engineers, in all different levels, to work together and find jobs which assess them on skills related to the job.

## How will this help managers/recruiters and companies?

Internships are the best talent acquisition method companies have. However, Developers Path is more effective than internships. Why?
  
  - Companies are able to save money and time
  - Companies are able to target high quality candidates
  - Companies are able to give engineers *more* opportunities, *more* frequently.
  - Companies are able to use a better model of reqruiting. 

Companies no longer have to wait for the seasonal internships to begin. They can start reqruiting engineers to join teams/projects at a faster pace. This allows engineers to have more opportunities to build their skills and impress employers. 

## What is wrong with the current model of recruiting?
A developer is assessed *heavily* on their ability to complete programming questions on data structures, algorithms, etc. While engineers *should* be strong in these subjects, it should not be the most important aspect in assessing the skills of an engineer. What is done on the job and what is done in these interviews are very different.

Entry-level engineers spend week, if not months, preparing for these interviews using online resources such as *Leetcode* and books such as *Cracking the Coding Interview*. When they finally make it to the interview, they might be asked a questions which they did not review or maybe even forgot because of the pressure of the moment. So, they get rejected even though they migh have been the perfect applicant. This method of interviewing does not show the true ability of an engineer and the

Now, there are those engineers who have been working for several years and are good at what they do. However, they will still have to go through the whole process of preparing for interviews when they want to switch jobs. They will have to spend a lot of time studying and using those resources. 

*But why do they have to go back? Don't they already have work experience?*

Well, that is the thing, these topics are rarely used on the job. So, they have to go back and review the material.

Developers Path makes it easy for companies to assess engineers on what is actually used on the job.

## How will this help engineers?
The hardest thing for engineers is finding projects/teams to work on. This makes it difficult to gain *real* experiences and apply their skills to *meaningful* projects. Developers Path solves this problem and brings real opportunities to engineers.
